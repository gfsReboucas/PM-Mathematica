Developer's Note
****************

From time to time, everyone comes up with 
an idea they'd like to see how that can be 
implemented in Mathematica.
If you come across an idea that you think 
might make a nice enhancement to the upcoming versions
of dynamics related books with Mathematica, 
your input is always welcome.  Please send 
any suggestions or requests for new features 
to cchin@vt.edu.

All the inputs you provide to Dynamics Press, Inc. will
be considered in the upcoming books or packages so that
we all can share with everyone else's experiences.
We offer free consultation for Mathematica related problems.
Please feel free to contact Dr. Char-Ming Chin (cchin@vt.edu)
in this regard.
